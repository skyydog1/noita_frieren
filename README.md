### USAGE
1. Drag the frieren folder into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Noita\mods 
2. Launch the game, from the menu toggle the frieren mod under mods tab
3. Play :)

__PLEASE NOTE__: This is not finished. When it's finished it will be uploaded to steam. I still need to fix invis, fix probably a lot of other stuff.

Working on adding Fern now!
