### USAGE
1. Download the frieren folder and its respective files
2. Copy the file into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Noita\mods 
3. Launch the game menu and toggle the frieren mod under mods tab
4. Play :)

__PLEASE NOTE__: This is not finished. When it's finished it will be uploaded to steam. I still need to fix invis, fix probably a lot of other stuff, and add Fern.
